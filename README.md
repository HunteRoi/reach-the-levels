# Reach The Levels

This [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project has been bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as its official ORM.
It also heavily relies on [Material UI](https://mui.com) to display and style content.

And now, a little bit of show! Here below, a running example of the project and a quick demo of the Prisma Studio:

## Next.js documentation

As such, all the default settings for a Next.js app applies:

-   you can run a development server with

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

-   you can access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

-   you can easiliy deploy this app with the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js (check out their [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details).

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

-   [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can also check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/).

## Styling your own app with MUI

You can customize the theme of this app in [/src/styles/theme.ts](./src/styles/theme.ts). I would also recommend to check out [MUI documentation](https://mui.com/getting-started/usage/) on the web!

## Combined with Prisma

I am using Prisma as my ORM. This grants me a lot of cool features, such as a local web studio to edit my database. Check out their documentation!
